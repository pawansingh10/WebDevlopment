## Assignment - Build Cards from Codepen

- Build 4 cards
  - You have to create a big webpage, that webpage background could be an image or could be gradient or a solid black/green color.
  - At the very center of this page, we need to have one card just like previous login card.
  - Card has few elements an image centered or square image at top
  - a title a subtitle
  - two buttons : Buy now add to wishlist/cart instead of text you can use icons
  - For this take inspiration from How things can be done. Don't just exactly copy paste it. Add your own flovour to it.
  - Search on google icon for web, one of them is [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start)
  - To get the inspiration How the card should look like, first of all work on the positioning of the card. If you want to display all the 4 cards at once, that's a;so fine
    if you want to have 4 different pages that's also fine. Feel free to use flexbox or grid use wahtever make sense.
  - Look for a website know as card HTML CSS codepen [Codepen](https://codepen.io/tag/card)
  - Codepen actually is an environment which gives you HTMl CSS and they tags each project which're freely avaialble for you to work or take inspiration or even you code.

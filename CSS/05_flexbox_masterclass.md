## Flexbox Masterclass

If we introduced with flexbox all the properties at start all feel boring.<br>
that's we introduce flexbox in just one or two ways like especially in building up navigation bar it's digestable otherwise it's too lengthy there're lot of properties.<br>
 
 Now we can learn Flexbox<br>
Here we will learn about flexbox and everything we can possibly do.<br>
Flexbox is really awesome and common even if you plan to go on mobile development later on a lot of things use Flexbox, especially the react native world<br>

But here our focus is to learn basics of it.

When we go with Flexbox there're 2 concepts that we need to remember in our mind
1. **Main Access**<br>
2. Other Access It is known by varieties of name like **Alternative Access**<br>

In the world of web, whatever you says Flexbox that means the main access is going to run from left to right, yes It's horizontal bar. and the reason for that is 
some of the properties are attached to the main access and some of the properties are attached to the other access

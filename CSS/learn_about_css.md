 CSS =  Cascading Style Sheet<br>
 The whole idea of having the CSS is **to make your website beautiful** on the mobile, on the big screen(PCs), medium screen(ipad).

 Ofcourse, we're going to learn CSS, but Let's be Honest, as a software engineer, We're not absolute 100% design person. We're more of a programming person. But this doesn't means We don't know design,
 We know foundations and basics of it, but most of us don't enjoy writting the CSS that much. But this doesn't means our website don't look that good.They look absolutely fantastic and just like any other professional design them. like websites in the corporates and for big startups, unicorns we will do the same as well.<br>

 There is a way How the CSS is written in a professional manner and how it should taught for the students who just getting started.<br>

 CSS is an art in itself. There're artist of the CSS available in the market like Youtube and other places. They really can nail down the designs, animations etc just kije what you see on somewhat like Apple
 website and other fancy websites which go crazy which we no need at the start.<br>

 We will learn enough of the basics and foundations<br>

 - ðŸ¦‹ CSS has two parts : -
     1. Learning of the Foundations
     2. Making Website beautiful

> The more you know the foundation easier it to make beautiful, especially in the modern era

- In upcoming time in next 1-2 years you don't need to do everything from scratch, but you need to know enough of the foundation so that you can change the things whenever you want and however you want.
  You will know exactly where the things are not working, you know exactly when things are working and why they are working. That's exactly we're going to learn.

- We will go through the ground basics of the CSS, but before that let's see some of the Libraries and explore.

- HTML doesn't required anything, you just start writing, but also notices when we have solutions like Emmet, we were able to write out HTML faster. Exactly same like this, We have CSS libraries as well, which help us to make things easier and make our life easier.
  
- Let's so go through some of libraries and we will see how these days Applications are being built.

## CSS

- CSS =  Cascading Style Sheet, things which **make your website beautiful** <br>
Example : Which makes you button Top-right corner, center, button of the page, stylings, colors and backgrounds all of these things is done through CSS.<br>

- But you don't have to write these CSS absolultely manually. There're some piece of code that are given to you<br>
  Examples : Some Cards, Top Navigation bars, etc you just customized them the way you want. But ofcourse this also requires CSS skills where you want to place that at the top/botton/center whereever you want.

- First unspoken Hero of these CSS libraries is **Bootstrap**, it's little bit dated now but still many websites which use that and this will give you enough of the idea that library is being used .

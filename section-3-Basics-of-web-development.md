## üçÄ Basics of Web Development

Before we jump into the development actually writing code, It's important to understand few things<br> 
**How does the internet work?** means How does one computer connects to the another computer?

It's fascinating and surprized by How good this engineering is!<br>
Connecting one computer to another computer is state of the art engineering.

### üåê How does Internet work?

What does mean by Internet?<br>
The ability to connect one computer to another computer all round the world through through a wire called **Internet**. That's all the basics of it.<br>

But the How it does is magical and fasinating. We're able to do it all seamlessly, that's the power of engineering.

Any computer you see like google.come, instagram.com, x.com etc all are actually not known by these names, They are all known with an **IP address**<br>
The IP Address looks like 192.168.2.5 <br>
There is a entire stream of a engineering in knowing just about these IP addresses known as **Networking**. You'll see the exam in CISCO for networking.<br>

Each of the computer gets IP Address which is unique in itself. But just with IP Address you can't rememeber the IP Address.<br>

Now You have one computer which has its unique IP Address and Google.com has its own computer which also has a unique IP Address. Now can you connect both of them NO!,  It doesn't happens like that<br>

So, You have one computer which has its unique IP Address and Google.com has its own computer which also has a unique IP Address. Now can you connect both of them NO!,  It doesn't happens like that<br>

### üí• Internet

- You have an **ISP** that means people from where you have bought your internet might be **Airtel, Jio, Starlink** etc. which are Internet Service Provider.
So, we simply go ahead and first connect with IP that Hey I want to connect to a website known as google.com. He says I don't know who is the owner of the google.com and I don't know How to connect that.<br>

- So, They reach out to something known as **DNS** Domain Name System. This is long phonebook of the internet and every ISP has this phonebook and It keeps on updating timely basis.
There are lot of chains to these DNS so that until it reaches out and resolve that.

- So, ISP reach out to DNS and say Hey, somebody is looking for google.com I don't know who that is, so can you give me the ip address of that? and they go ahead and look for something like [**NsLookUp.io**](https://www.nslook.io) or something they've inbuilt solution for that. and they go ahead and say Hey you were looking for google.com, Just go ahead and find its DNS record. So once you go ahead and find this DNS record, that will look like , They say Hey, this is the IP Address of it. It goes ahead and copy paste it and then it goes ahead and tell it that, This google.com is can resolve by this ip address and this is being served to ISP.

- Now **ISP provider goes to the big gigantic globe of something known as Internet, which is just a mesh of cables.**
and they try to look for this IP Address. once they go ahead and look for this ip address, they eventually find this and gives you back by saying Hey, now you're able to connect with this.

> **This whole connection process is your internet.That's all your internet.That's how it works.**

Note : Now these names google.com, facebook.com etc etc are provided by some authorities and providers which gives you these names.<br>
Eaxmple : [**GoDaddy**](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in) is famous one<br>
**Name Cheap**, **Big Rock** etc

### ‚ùì Questions that's comes in mind as a biginners

- **If my computer has an ip address, can I just host my own website?**<br>
Yes, Certainly you can do but the problem is you have to keep your computer up and running all the time.<br>
That's why there are some providers which are specilized in keeping thier computer running all the time.<br>
Example :  **Google GCP | Amazon  AWS | Microsoft Azure | Digital Ocean | Linord |** <br>

We'll How we can actually host your website so that it is up and available all the time without you worrying about. <br>

We'll not only make our website, we'll deploy our website to the production so that millions and millions of people can actually serve your project/web application.

> **‚ú® Summary : Mystery of Internet is not complex, It is just communication between the ISP, DNS which give you IP address and by which you're able to connect to any website that you see around**

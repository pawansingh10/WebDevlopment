# üçÄ Basics of Web Development

Before we jump into the development actually writing code, It's important to understand few things<br> 
**How does the internet work?** means How does one computer connects to the another computer?

It's fascinating and surprized by How good this engineering is!<br>
Connecting one computer to another computer is state of the art engineering.

### üåê How does Internet work?

What does mean by Internet?<br>
The ability to connect one computer to another computer all round the world through through a wire called **Internet**. That's all the basics of it.<br>

But the How it does is magical and fasinating. We're able to do it all seamlessly, that's the power of engineering.

Any ccomputer you see like google.come, instagram.com, x.com etc all are actually not known by these names, They are all known with an **IP address**<br>
The IP Address looks like 192.168.2.5 <br>
There is a entire stream of a engineering in knowing just about these IP addresses known as **Networking**. You'll see the exam in CISCO for networking.<br>

Each of the computer gets IP Address which is unique in itself. But just with IP Address you can't rememeber the IP Address.<br>

Now You have one computer which has its unique IP Address and Google.com has its own computer which also has a unique IP Address. Now can you connect both of them NO!,  It doesn't happens like that<br>

### ðŸ¤” Hey, Feeling Anxious, Is AI going to take our Job?

In the age of AI, Is it worth to learn Web Dev? <br>
AI is really good and It's a nice thing to have.

Nothing is to be worried about?

Ai is really a friendly tool that you're having in your bag. Earlier programmer used to write all of the Code by hand everything. As the tools got evolved and matured, now we have suggestions based tools which 
which can fill your boilerplate code.

ðŸ›« AI is an assistance that is helping you to write your code and your software faster and ship your product.<br>
It will help you to be more effiecient, more faster in fixing the bug.

| **Hidden secret about the Software Engineering or Web Development** |   **100%**  | **Time Distribution**   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|
| **20% of the time just for Writing the Code** | **30 % of the time for Fixing the Bug** | **What about rest 50% of the time**|

> **The rest 50% time, you handle meetings, Understand the client requirements and Propose possible solution which could be the best solution**<br>
Should we use X database or Y database?<br>
Should we picking up X technology or Y technology?

Yes, AI can produce the code but it's not all the best code at the first time.<br>
Sometime Software developer can write much faster code compare to AI

How we can take advantages of these AI tools and plugin to write code faster?<br>
BUT BUT BUT after a certain time.<br>
Remember on thing, no matter how good the tools become, eventually end of the day foundations are really important so that you can debug those things<br>
You know exactly where the source of the problem is and why is it not behaving the way it should be?
